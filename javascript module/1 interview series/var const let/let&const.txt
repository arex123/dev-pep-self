LET & CONST

* Temporal Dead Zone 
* { Block } scope
* variable shadowing
* var/let/const


--> The Temporal Dead Zone is a behavior in JavaScript that occurs when declaring a variable with the let and const keywords, but not with var. A shorthand you’ll often hear to describe it is that “Let’s don’t hoist,” but this is not technically true



--> In JavaScript, variable declarations (but not assignments) are hoisted to the top of the scope. 


-->The JavaScript interpreter works in a two-step process:

compile time: run through all code looking for variable/function declarations

runtime: execute the code including assignments and function invocations
