/*template litrals are the backtick quoted string, they can embed variable or values inside them

`half of 100 is ${100 / 2}`
When you write something inside ${} in a template literal, its result will be computed, converted to a string, and included at that position. The example produces “half of 100 is 50”.


console.log(`half of 100 is ${100/2}`);
